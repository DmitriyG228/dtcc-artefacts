## Meeting Agenda Overview

### 1. Introduction & Community Information
- **Milestone:** This is the 30th meeting since inception in August 2021
- **Appreciation expressed to:** Hyperledger Foundation, Financial Markets Special Interest Group, presenters, and attendees (both live and YouTube streaming)
- **Antitrust Policy & Code of Conduct:** All participants must adhere to Hyperledger's antitrust policy (avoid company-specific pricing discussion, no negative remarks about competitors) and code of conduct (respect, constructive communication, support openness and inclusion)
- **Resources Available:**
  - Mortgage Subgroup Wiki with all recordings and articles
  - Free Hyperledger Fabric certification
  - Free blockchain training materials
  - LF ID access (required for wiki)

### 2. Industry Updates: Blockchain & AI Trends

**JP Morgan - Project Guardian**
- Started May 2022 as collaborative effort (JP Morgan, DBS Bank, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, Wisdom Tree)
- Focus: Decentralized finance applications, asset tokenization, wholesale funding markets
- Goals: Open/interoperable networks, institutional-grade DeFi products, trusted infrastructure
- Recent work: Pilot program with Monetary Authority of Singapore; converting to tangible products
- Wisdom Tree initiative: Unified interface for tokenized portfolios and trading/banking services
- Opportunity: Money market fund tokenization with stablecoins for diversification and risk management

**Morgan Stanley - AI Integration**
- March 2023: Partnership with OpenAI as sole wealth management strategic partner
- AI at Morgan Stanley Debrief: OpenAI-powered tool generating meeting summaries, action items, client emails
- AI at Morgan Stanley Assistant: GenAI chatbot providing access to firm's intellectual capital
- Adoption: 98% of financial advisor teams have adopted the assistant
- Impact: Financial advisors can focus on client relationships with more human touch

**Blockchain Council Article on AI-Blockchain Convergence**
- **Blockchain's contribution to AI:**
  - Strengthens AI data security through immutability
  - Prevents tampering; enables data sharing without single point of failure
  - Facilitates collaborative AI where shared learning is essential
  
- **AI's enhancement of blockchain:**
  - Boosts efficiency through smart algorithms
  - Reduces transaction processing time and energy consumption
  - Improves security via machine learning threat detection in real-time
  - Case studies: Healthcare, supply chain, financial sector

**Mark D'Angelo's Perspective on Data-First AI Approach**
- **Key insight:** AI represents a "step-function shift" in how to provision systems, not incremental improvement
- **Fundamental difference:** Focus shifts from process-vendor-outsourcer model to data-integrity-ethics model
- **Industry recognition:** After 3 years of contraction/flatlining, perfect time to rethink data strategies
- **Transition from Gen AI to industry-specific AI:**
  - Gen AI (large language models) has 40% non-industry data
  - Mortgage industry (60% data sourced internally) needs ring-fenced models
  - Cost implication: Industry-specific models cost millions vs. billions for general LLMs
  - Solution: Federated AI, data partnerships, industry associations
- **Critical point:** Not incremental change like fintech/regtech adoption; fundamental architectural shift
- **Innovation:** Using synthetic humans and AI to narrate MBA articles (different engagement model)

## MISMO's Role & Initiatives

### Organization Overview
- **Mortgage standards organization** maintaining data model for entire industry
- **Membership:** 2,000+ members with 580-600 active volunteers
- **Structure:** 39 work groups and communities of practice
- **Areas:** Blockchain (led by Devin Caster), Smart Docs, Servicing, and new AI community of practice

### AI Community of Practice
- **Genesis:** Early 2023 (post-ChatGPT launch) member requests for AI forum
- **Evolution (9 months):** From "what is AI?" to "who's implementing it?" to "how do I compete?"
- **AI Forum participants:** AWS, Google, Rocket, large lenders, service providers, US Senate offices
- **Key finding:** Widespread misconception that AI will eliminate human workers/decision-making
- **Actual use cases in mortgage industry:**
  - Developer assistance for code streamlining and efficiency
  - Chatbot supplementation for website user experience (not decision-making)
  - Document reading and data extraction (transitioning from paper processes)
  - NOT: Full autonomous underwriting without human-in-the-loop

### Blockchain Community of Practice
- **Formation:** 2018 (evolved from emerging tech discussions)
- **Original charter:** Identify mortgage use cases for blockchain; explore standardization opportunities
- **Key deliverable:** White paper (18-month effort) positioning blockchain as viable, high-potential technology
- **Current focus (50/50 split):**
  - Education (largest impediment to adoption)
  - Prototyping (recent shift from freeware to commercial tools at inflection point)
- **Education initiatives:**
  - Lunch-and-learn sessions (decentralized identifiers, self-sovereign identity)
  - Non-technical explanation of blockchain (first successful "light bulb" moment achieved)
  - Convergence of AI and blockchain discussions
- **Prototyping work:**
  - Interoperability focus (multiple blockchain implementations needed)
  - Using MISMO standards to bridge between blockchains
  - Recent shift: Moving toward theoretical/conceptual work as commercial requirements grow
- **Standards discovery:** Ongoing as prototypes evolve

## Evolution in Narrative: From Crypto Mortgages to Tokenization

**Past perception (2.5 years ago):** "Crypto mortgages" - viewed as speculative, high-risk

**Current narrative:** Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA)

**Key companies involved:**
- Figur (tokenized mortgages; pivoted to HELOC focus)
- Liquid Mortgage / Liquid Fi (tokenized mortgage assets)
- Hexil Blockchain (mortgage tokenization)

**Regulatory complexities:**
- Figur/Liquid Fi focus on private markets (HELOC, non-conforming, portfolio lending) to avoid federal GSE regulations
- Conforming/conventional loans require coordination with: SEC, CFPB, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae
- **Critical lesson:** Maersk shipping blockchain (best blockchain use case) failed due to regulations in hundreds of countries; regulatory planning must be front-end, not afterthought
- **Data control prerequisite:** Must establish "trusted data ecosystem" before true tokenization benefits realized

---

## Interoperability & Standards as Foundation

**Core principle:** Data standards enable blockchain interoperability

**MISMO's approach:**
- **API Toolkit:** Converts MISMO XML schema into compliant APIs for blockchain data transfer
- **ELDD (Electronic Loan Data Dictionary):** Recent evolution from XML schema; uses unique identifiers and relationships between data elements
- **Generative AI opportunity:** Use Gen AI to transform data schemas between different blockchains (novel approach)
- **Smart Docs 2.0:** PDF + data packaged as tamper-proof/tamper-evident artifact; eliminates multiple stare-and-compare validation checks

**GSE participation:**
- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac members; active in blockchain community of practice
- Have proprietary "U" standards built on MISMO data model
- Send 6-10 representatives to MISMO summits
- Janie Mae (Federal Home Loan Bank partner) confirmed active participation

## AI-Blockchain Convergence: Data-Centric Architecture

**Paradigm shift (David Coleman's framing):**
- Traditional: Linear transactions flowing through systems
- Future: Data-centric model where AI agents query trusted data sources
- Source control: Logical data model (MISMO language) establishes single source of truth

**Federated AI approach (Mark D'Angelo's framework):**
- Don't transfer all data downstream
- Query trusted sources with validated, ethically-sourced data
- Data immutability (blockchain or equivalent) ensures integrity
- Enables AI-to-AI communication across enterprise without data replication

**Consumer impact:**
- Errors at point A cascade to point 23 if not managed (critical concern)
- Standards governance becomes more important as automation increases
- Regulatory compliance must be transparent and auditable
