## Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Shadow Money Narrative (2019)
- **Context:** Libra (later Diem) proposed by Meta/Facebook in June 2019
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Global stablecoin pegged to basket of currencies
  - Consortium of 40 companies (Visa, PayPal, etc.)
  - Seen as threat to US Dollar and global financial system
- **Congressional Response:**
  - Maxine Waters (D-House): Expressed concerns about "Swiss-based Financial system too big to fail"
  - Sherrod Brown (D-Senate): Led opposition
  - HR 5197 proposed redefining stablecoins as Securities to kill them
  - Classified multi-currency stablecoins as "managed coins" similar to mutual funds
- **Outcome:** Libra rebranded to Diem with single-currency pegs; project ultimately abandoned by end of 2020

### 2. Transition Period & Regulatory Shift (2020-2021)
- **OCC Support:** Brian Brooks (OCC) issued interpretive letters supporting stablecoins
  - September 2020: National Banks can hold reserves for stablecoin issuers
  - January 2021: Stablecoins compatible with independent node verification networks (payment rails)
  - Compared stablecoins to traveler's checks
- **Wildcat Money Framing:** Historical comparison to Free Banking Era (pre-Civil War)
  - Article: "Wildcat Currencies and Stablecoins" by Noll
  - Gorton & Jiang (2021): "Taming Wildcat Stablecoins"
  - "NQA Principle" (No Questions Asked) - concept of maintaining single price across different stablecoin issuers
- **Congressional Legislation:** HR 8827 (Stable Act - Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement Act)
  - Proposed by Talib Lynch, Sylvia Garcia (all Democrats)
  - Target: Tether (seen as out of control)
  - Redefined stablecoins as USD-pegged, domestically issued
  - Solution: Convert stablecoin issuers into pseudo-banks or regulated entities with FDIC insurance
  - Goal: Create "national banking system" for stablecoins analogous to Civil War-era reforms

### 3. Payment Stablecoins & Future Money Narrative (2021-2024)
- **Presidential Working Group (November 2021):** Introduced term "payment stablecoins"
  - Definition: Digital assets with stable value connected to fiat currency, used as widespread means of payment
  - Focus: Retail stablecoins for everyday transactions (not DeFi-only instruments)
  - First appearance of term signaled shift in narrative
- **Nelly Liang (Treasury Under Secretary):** Quote - "Stablecoins are a Cornerstone of a new payment system"
  - Dramatic shift from 2019's existential threat framing
- **2022 Congressional Bills:**
  - **S.3504 (Pat Toomey, R):** Defined payment stablecoins as:
    - Digital assets with stable value
    - Convertible into fiat
    - Widely used as medium of exchange
    - Issued by centralized entity (not decentralized)
    - Not paying interest (not security)
    - On distributed ledger (usually DLT)
  - **Lummis-Gillibrand Bill:** Similar definition, different regulatory regime
    - Bipartisan support (Lummis=R, Gillibrand=D)
    - Federal Reserve involvement with all stablecoin issuers
  - **HR 4766 (Patrick McHenry, R - "Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act"):**
    - Passed House Finance Committee
    - Payment stablecoins: redeemable, not national currency, not security
    - McHenry quote: "Stablecoins hold the promise as a pillar of our 21st century payment system"
    - Awaiting House floor vote at time of presentation
- **Regulatory Debate:** State control (R) vs. Federal Reserve oversight (D)

### 4. Narrative Comparison: 2019 vs. 2024

| Dimension | 2019 (Shadow Money) | 2024 (Future Money) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Threat Level** | Existential threat to global economy | Vital to US competitiveness |
| **Issuer Type** | Shadow Banks | Regulated entities |
| **Geography** | Global/transnational | US-based/domestic |
| **Peg** | Basket of currencies | Single USD peg |
| **Congressional Action** | Ban/eliminate | Regulate and enable |
| **Quotes** | "Too big to fail" / "Swiss financial system" | "Cornerstone of new payment system" / "Pillar of 21st century payments" |

### 5. Causation Analysis: Why Did Narratives Change?

**Shadow Money → Wildcat Money:**
- Facebook's reputation damage reduced visceral opposition
- OCC and regulatory bodies began seeing value and regulatory pathways
- Stablecoin issuers moved from anathema to "something to control"
- Limited early crypto lobbying activity

**Wildcat Money → Future Money:**
- 2021 crypto bull market (huge capital flows)
- USD-pegged stablecoins grew from ~$20B to ~$100B+ market cap
- Coinbase IPO (NASDAQ) legitimized crypto infrastructure
- Presidential Working Group (Biden administration) introduced "payment stablecoins" framework
- Bipartisan recognition of stablecoins as technology for US dominance
- Shift from domestic control focus to technological/dollar supremacy

## Q&A Discussion

### CBDCs and Stablecoin Relationship
- **Question:** How do changes in CBDCs influence stablecoin policy?
- **Noll's Response:** 
  - White House pushed CBDC strongly (late 2021)
  - Republican opposition to government digital dollar ("no digital dollar" stance - Tom Emmer)
  - Republicans may support private stablecoins as CBDC alternative
  - Potential partisan positioning: Democrats want CBDC; Republicans prefer regulated private stablecoins

### Real-World Use Cases
- **Current Primary Use:** Cross-border remittances
  - Stellar's stablecoin remittance system
  - USDC + go wallet for sending money home
  - Avoids Western Union and banking intermediaries
- **Speculative Future Uses:**
  - Company-issued stablecoins with loyalty rewards (analogous to credit card rewards)
  - Local/municipal stablecoins (e.g., Pittsburgh issues local currency, funds infrastructure)
  - Unlikely near-term: Mass retail point-of-sale (can already use phone payment systems)

### Par and Stablecoin Stability
- **Discussion Lead:** Alexander Grogg and others raised concerns about par (maintaining 1:1 peg)
- **Key Points:**
  - Stablecoins have broken par in past crises (similar to money market funds in 2008)
  - Stress testing reveals break-of-par risk
  - Reliance on central bank money (highest form of money per "money view" / Perry Mehrling)
  - Central banks can issue at will; cannot experience runs (only inflation/deflation affects value)
  - Stablecoins face run risk from reserve mismatches (duration mismatch: instant redemption vs. reserve duration)

### Seigniorage and Transaction Costs
- **Issue:** 3% transaction cost on current payment rails
- **Stablecoin Advantage:** Potentially lower transaction costs
- **CBDC Alternative:** Even lower costs with central bank
- **Concern:** Merchant cost pass-through (e.g., $1 pizza → $1.25+ with margins)
- **Crypto Aversion:** Credit element missing in crypto/stablecoins (unlike traditional finance)

### Cross-Border Transactions
- **Question:** Do upcoming regulations permit cross-border stablecoin transactions?
- **Noll's Response:** Not explicitly discussed in bills
- **Key Regulatory Concern:** Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), KYC/AML compliance
- **Strategic Goal:** US-issued stablecoins to push back against offshore stablecoins (Tether)
- **Complication:** USD stablecoins become global currency → enters dollar supremacy realm
- **Reference:** Perry Mehrling's "On Par" paper; compares stablecoins to Eurodollars (offshore dollars)

### Interoperability & SATP
- **SATP (Secure Asset Transfer Protocol):** Mentioned as potential regulatory framework
- **Treasury Perspective:** Focus on interoperability issues
- **Federal Reserve Paper:** "Fit for Purpose" (2022) - already addresses mechanisms for maintaining par
- **Friction Levels:** Commercial bank money frictionlessly converts to cash (same perception despite being private money)

### Cultural & Strategic Factors
- **Observation:** US cultural preference for small government + private sector solutions
- **However:** Stable coin approach as alternative to CBDC when Fed control unwelcome
- **Perry Drucker Reference:** "Culture, strategy, and technology" - culture change requires feeling threatened
  - Global dollar system threat → incentivizes alternatives
  - Acceptance of CBDC more likely if global alternatives threaten US dominance

## Key Insights & Tensions

1. **Narrative as Policy Driver:** Government positions shifted primarily due to narrative reframing, not fundamental technology change
2. **Political Pragmatism:** Republican support for private stablecoins partly motivated by CBDC opposition
3. **Par Problem Unresolved:** Duration mismatch and run risk remain unsolved technical challenges
4. **Use Case Gap:** Real retail use cases limited; mostly remittances; mass adoption timeline uncertain
5. **Jurisdictional Tension:** US-issued stablecoins become global assets → raises sovereignty/dollar supremacy questions
6. **Regulatory Gaps:** Cross-border KYC/AML enforcement and interoperability mechanisms still under development
7. **Financial System Risk:** Seigniorage capture and 3% transaction tax shift incentives in payment system architecture
